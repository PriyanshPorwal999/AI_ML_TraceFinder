## üéØ About the Project

Scanned documents like legal agreements, official certificates, and financial records are easy to forge. It's often impossible to tell if a scanned document is legitimate or if it was created using an unauthorized, fraudulent device.

**AI TraceFinder** solves this problem by identifying the source scanner used to create a digital image.

Every scanner, due to its unique hardware, introduces microscopic and invisible *‚Äúfingerprints‚Äù* into an image. These include specific noise patterns, texture artifacts, and compression traces. This project uses machine learning to train models that recognize these unique signatures, allowing you to:

- Attribute a scanned document to a specific scanner model.  
- Detect forgeries where unauthorized scanners were used.  
- Verify the authenticity of scanned evidence in a forensic context.

<!-- #  AI TraceFinder ‚Äî Forensic Scanner Identification  

##  Overview  
AI TraceFinder is a forensic machine learning platform that identifies the **source scanner device** used to digitize a document or image. Each scanner (brand/model) introduces unique **noise, texture, and compression artifacts** that serve as a fingerprint. By analyzing these patterns, AI TraceFinder enables **fraud detection, authentication, and forensic validation** in scanned documents.  

---

##  Goals & Objectives  
- Collect and label scanned document datasets from multiple scanners  
- Robust preprocessing (resize, grayscale, normalize, denoise)  
- Extract scanner-specific features (noise, FFT, PRNU, texture descriptors)  
- Train classification models (ML + CNN)  
- Apply explainability tools (Grad-CAM, SHAP)  
- **Deploy an interactive app for scanner source identification**  
- Deliver **accurate, interpretable results** for forensic and legal use cases  

---

##  Methodology 
1. **Data Collection & Labeling**  
   - Gather scans from 3‚Äì5 scanner models/brands  
   - Create a structured, labeled dataset  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Resize, grayscale, normalize  
   - Optional: denoise to highlight artifacts  

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   - PRNU patterns, FFT, texture descriptors (LBP, edge features)  

4. **Model Training**  
   - Baseline ML: SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  
   - Deep Learning: CNN with augmentation  

5. **Evaluation & Explainability**  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix  
   - Interpretability: Grad-CAM, SHAP feature maps  

6. **Deployment**  
   - Streamlit app ‚Üí upload scanned image ‚Üí predict scanner model  
   - Display confidence score and key feature regions

##  Actionable Insights for Forensics  
- **Source Attribution:** Identify which scanner created a scanned copy of a document.  
- **Fraud Detection:** Detect forgeries where unauthorized scanners were used.  
- **Legal Verification:** Validate whether scanned evidence originated from approved devices.  
- **Tamper Resistance:** Differentiate between authentic vs. tampered scans.  
- **Explainability:** Provide visual evidence of how classification was made.
